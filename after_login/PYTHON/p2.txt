a high level interpret programming language famous for its enlightened it's arguably the most popular languish in the world because it's easy to learn ye practical for serious projects in fact you're watching this youtube video in a fight on by the application right now he was greeted by three of them were awesome and released in nineteen ninety one to get after monty python's flying circus which is why else sometimes finds band aids instead of doing far it has samples is commonly used to build server side applications like well that's what it is covering for him his language ways for the data analysis and she learned many students choose python to start learning because of because of its emphasis on the ability as outlined by the senate by talk of beautiful is better than lovely well exquisite is better than implicit python is very simple one of which the temptation to sprinkle in bad shape that causes ambiguity it's code is often organizing to build boats were individual cells and executed been documented in the same way it's work early aversion to people when swift and get started by creating a file that vincent occupied with iq windy to creating interactive note that put variable by setting these names equal to evaluate it strongly ties which means values won't change in unexpected ways that they can make so tight imitations are not required to sin taxes highly efficient allowing you to declare multiple variables on a single line and applying to schools whisenand dictionaries with it what rules untaxed semi courts are not required and used an inexperienced tightenings that will say that your code is not python and instead of semi corns python uses indentation to terminate were determine the scope of their wives to define a function with the death keyword been intense and next line usually by force bases to define the function body we might then have a forward to it and then that fight another force bases this one is the need for curly gray says a semi courts found in many other languages python is a multi paradigm ways which we can apply for a chauffeur henri patterns with things like anonymous function seized one and it also uses objects as an abstraction for dana allowing you to bomb as object oriented patterns that things like classes and her test it also has a huge ecosystems after forty libraries such as steep learning from works with time served well and robbers were many high performance global package is wide open keep your vision pusher most often and sold with benefit package manager this is done the python programming language at one hundred seconds to polite and if you wanna see more for videos like this place for watch it and i will see you in the next one

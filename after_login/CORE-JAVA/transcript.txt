Transcription: ok so we were able to run this code and we understood something what is happening behind the scene right so basically we know now that as a programmer as a Java developer you write a Java code which will be having dot Java Extension and that gets compiled by JavaScript and then when you when you compile the code what you get in output is a bytecode which will be having dot class file and then you can run the dot class file in your JVM basically it's a part of GRE which will have JVM as well as a libraries lot of classes and then everything is a part of a grey you will be installing on OS right so basically you need to have a hardware of course the machine to run right that machine will be having OS will be having which will have JVM but as a developer you will need one more tool which is JDK now when you install a new JDK you get the updated GRE and JVM with it ok so the version of JDK which we are using his dedicated 17 which is LTS which is long term support and in every new version you get some minor extra features right so even if you are watching this after 10 years of 8 years of 5 years you will be having new version of Java of course next 5 years you will get 10 new versions and every new version will have many updates but the best thing remains same right so what are your learning is same in Java 1 so don't worry about the new updates the code concept you have this thing what next we can do not think about this world of course first of all why we will solve it so that we can solve a problem now what problem we are trying to solve so basically we are trying to solve the real world problems with the help of virtual world example you wanted to buy something so you got Amazon which delivers everything at home so you got Amazon is online service you wanted to book a cab you got Uber so for every problem we have a solution in the virtual world write a banking is happening online now when you say you are replacing the real world with a virtual solution so basically we need to work with one thing the most important thing now is actually data so basically we want to work with data how will you work with data so basically you need data as well as processing on it so whatever whenever we build a project or when you will the application what we are doing is we are doing the processing on the data can be coming from user or something so maybe you will accept the data from the user and then you will do some work with it maybe you want to show this exactly do we store data so we store data in something called database so we have a database in which you will be showing your data so whatever data you are getting from the user or from after processing so let's say we got a user here user data we will apply a processing on that we will do some work in between and at the end we might store data in database not this database is actually a permanent storage or a persistent storage which you say when you say it is permanent that doesn't mean you can't change it of course you can you can replace the values as well but then the data is there if you just store it and even if you shut down your machine the data will be stored example when you copy movies or games on your laptop it is there right it will get deleted when you say that you will receive data from the user and then you will be doing some processing on that when you will store the data for temporary purpose during processing you have to store your data somewhere and that somewhere is variable so this is where you store your data now what is variable images you want to store your data can be numeric it can be text it can be image what do you understand talking to Java in general when you say you want to store data in a box it can be of type numbers it can be of type text or image or video

Java a boilerplate driven language designed for writing verbose object-oriented instant Legacy code it came into being thanks to a Relentless hype campaign by Sun Microsystems in the middle of the.com bubble it's kind of like the Macaulay Culkin of programming languages it was originally invented to create a better TV remote then it officially launched for public use in 1996 and nobody's bothered to update the website ever since regardless Java has been running on three billion devices for the last 25 years most of which are Blu-ray players it's motto is right ones running everywhere which developers know actually means right ones debug everywhere remember the log for JPS go you can blame Java for that one still Java has a great mask on a little one-eyed monster named Duke and people love to hate it so much that it's inspired an entire class of programming language is designed to make Java better like groovy closure skull in just to name a few unfortunately though there is no cure Java also inspired JavaScript a language that is taken developers 25 years to make halfway decent and one time Jawa even tried to steal javascript's job with applets on the web what local sucks so bad they made HTML CSS and JavaScript look like a good abstraction for building ui's now when your company you'll also want to adopt Oracle database so you can spend the next 20 years talking about migrating to postgres well in Godley amount of money that will be directly reinvested into these awesome sailing Yachts to get started set aside a few days to install the jdk Jr in jvm on your machine it's also recommended that you have a vertical monitor to read the airlocks that are coming now before riding any code say this with me public main string Arts Publix now to say hello world create a class Java forces you into object oriented programming which means you'll want to read design patterns cover to cover before you go any further now it's time for your public static void main string arts and then finally systems with hello world as you can see we get a lot more boilerplate than something like python which is a feature and definitely not a fundamental design or anything you want to start by writing one giant bloated class then when your boss complains breaking into a hierarchy of deeply nested subclasses that will make an impossible to refactor the next step is to rage quit from your job life is way too short to be coding in and with that I think I've lost enough subscribers for one video there are only two kinds of languages the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses whether you love it or hate it and Java can get stuff done and for that it deserves our respect thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one

Java a high-level multiplying programming language famous for its ability to compile to platform Independent by code it was designed by James Gossling in 1990 at Sun Microsystems one of its first demonstrations was the star 7 PGA Tour to the Java mascot Duke today it's one of the world's most popular programming languages it Powers Enterprise web apps with spring framework Big Data pipelines with Hadoop mobile apps on Android and even things like the controller for NASA's Maestro Mars Rover what made it Innovative is that instead of compiling to machine code like C or C plus plus a compiles to bike code they can run on any operating system without recombining which is made possible by executing the code with the job of a virtual machine or jbm it's both a compiled language at the same time the computer just needs to have the Java runtime environment or JRE installed and most of them do for developers this means right ones run anywhere it's a strong language with a curly syntax similar to the Sea family however it provides more high level features like garbage collection and reflection to get started the job at every Java program starts with a class named which should match the file name the class is required to have a main method this is where your code will start executing inside the method Define a variable by starting with a type of a name to the standard output using system class now because we're inside of a class we Define functions as methods on this class the public keyword means that I can be used outside of this class and static means that it's a member of the class itself as opposed to an instance of the class we then provide a type and name and return a value from it you can Define your own custom classes which are blueprints for objects then add attributes and methods to that use the new keyword to instantiate an object from the class it feels very object oriented but has evolved to support functional patterns like in Anonymous Lambda methods when your program is finished use the compiler to generate a class file which contains the bike code now use the Java command to tell the jbm to interpret and run that file congratulations you just build in Enterprise great application this is has been in 100 seconds it subscribe for more short videos like this and if we somehow get you 100,000 likes on this video I'll do a full toriel thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one
